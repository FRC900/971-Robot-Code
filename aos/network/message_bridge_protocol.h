// The protocol between the message_bridge_client and server is pretty simple.
// The overarching design philosophy is that the server sends data to the
// client, and the client (optionally) sends timestamps back.
//
// 1) A connection is established by the client sending the server a Connect
//    flatbuffer on stream 0.
// 2) The server then replies with the data, as it is available, on streams 2 +
//    channel_id in the Connect message.
// 3) The client (optionally) replies on stream 1 with MessageHeader flatbuffers
//    with the timestamps that the messages were received.
//
// Most of the complexity from there is handling multiple clients and servers
// and persuading SCTP to do what we want.

// Number of streams reserved for control messages.

constexpr size_t kConnectStream() { return 0; }
