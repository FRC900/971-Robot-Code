    Args:

      srcs_filegroup_name: Name of the output filegroup that holds srcs. Pass this
          filegroup into the `includes` parameter of any other
          flatbuffer_cc_library that depends on this one's schemas.
      out_prefix: Prepend this path to the front of all generated files. Usually
          is a directory name.
      includes: Optional, list of filegroups of schemas that the srcs depend on.
          ** SEE REMARKS BELOW **
      include_paths: Optional, list of paths the includes files can be found in.
      flatc_args: Optional list of additional arguments to pass to flatc
          (e.g. --gen-mutable).
      visibility: The visibility of the generated cc_library. By default, use the
          default visibility of the project.
      target_compatible_with: Optional, the list of constraints the target
        platform must satisfy for this target to be considered compatible.
      srcs_filegroup_visibility: The visibility of the generated srcs filegroup.
          By default, use the value of the visibility parameter above.
      gen_reflections: Optional, if true this will generate the flatbuffer
        reflection binaries for the schemas.
      compatible_with: Optional, The list of environments this rule can be built
        for, in addition to default-supported environments.
      restricted_to: Optional, The list of environments this rule can be built
        for, instead of default-supported environments.

    This produces:
      filegroup([name]_srcs): all generated .h files.
      filegroup(srcs_filegroup_name if specified, or [name]_includes if not):
          Other flatbuffer_cc_library's can pass this in for their `includes`
          parameter, if they depend on the schemas in this library.
      Fileset([name]_reflection): (Optional) all generated reflection binaries.
      cc_library([name]): library with sources and flatbuffers deps.

    Remarks:
      ** Because the genrule used to call flatc does not have any trivial way of
        computing the output list of files transitively generated by includes and
        --gen-includes (the default) being defined for flatc, the --gen-includes
        flag will not work as expected. The way around this is to add a dependency
        to the flatbuffer_cc_library defined alongside the flatc included Fileset.
        For example you might define:

        flatbuffer_cc_library(
            name = "my_fbs",
            srcs = [ "schemas/foo.fbs" ],
            includes = [ "//third_party/bazz:bazz_fbs_includes" ],
        )

        In which foo.fbs includes a few files from the Fileset defined at
        //third_party/bazz:bazz_fbs_includes. When compiling the library that
        includes foo_generated.h, and therefore has my_fbs as a dependency, it
        will fail to find any of the bazz *_generated.h files unless you also
        add bazz's flatbuffer_cc_library to your own dependency list, e.g.:

        cc_library(
            name = "my_lib",
            deps = [
                ":my_fbs",
                "//third_party/bazz:bazz_fbs"
            ],
        )

        Happy dependent Flatbuffering!
