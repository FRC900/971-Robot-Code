Targets have positive Z axis pointing into the board, positive X to the right when looking at the board,
and positive Y is down when looking at the board.
This means that you will get an identity rotation from the camera to target
frame when the target is upright, flat, and centered in the camera's view for an upright camera.
For 2023 cameras, the target needs to be upside down for the identity rotation because the cameras are flipped.
