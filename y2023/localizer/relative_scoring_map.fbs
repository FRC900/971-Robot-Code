// This file provides a schema for a more stripped-down version of the
// ScoringMap. In this version, we try to deduplicate as much information
// as is reasonable so that it is easier for humans to modify and verify the
// numbers.
// In particular, we:
// * Assume that each batch of 9 scoring grid is identical with respect to
//   the april tag for that scoring grid.
// * Provide all coordinates relative to the april tags in question.
//
// Note that when we say "relative to the april tags," that does mean in the
// april tag frame. As such, the Z of the relative position will be how far
// behind the april tag the scoring position is (i.e., the X offset), the
// relative X will be to the right of the target, and the Y will be how far
// below the center of the target the scoring position is.

// The april tag ids for each field component on one half of the field.
